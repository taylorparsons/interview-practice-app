# Reference Library

This directory packages the refactoring playbooks that ship alongside the
interview-practice app. Each Markdown file focuses on a specific scenario so
engineers can quickly grab guidance while working inside the repo:

- `advanced_topics.md` &mdash; deep dives on large-scale or high-risk refactors
  such as Strangler Fig and Parallel Change patterns.
- `best_practices.md` &mdash; day-to-day guardrails for safe cleanup (testing,
  logging, rollbacks).
- `fastapi_patterns.md` &mdash; idiomatic patterns for FastAPI endpoints,
  dependency injection, and background tasks used throughout `app/`.
- `patterns.md` &mdash; quick-reference catalog of common refactoring patterns
  mentioned in code review feedback.
- `troubleshooting.md` &mdash; operational checklist for debugging session flow,
  realtime voice issues, and knowledge-store hiccups.

Keep these documents version-controlled so the team can evolve the shared
toolkit alongside the codebase.
