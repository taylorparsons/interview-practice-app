|--------|------|------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| PASSED | `tests.ui.test_homepage_smoke::test_homepage_upload_section_visible` | Candidate landing experience | Resume and job description upload controls render, so a candidate can begin the practice flow. | If this UI regresses, users cannot start the interview journey and churn immediately. | Investigate recent UI/layout changes and restore the upload form parity. |

## Notes
- All documented customer journeys exercised successfully. Monitor this report for regressions before releases.
