- Offer a balanced mix of behavioral (STAR + I), situational, and role-specific technical questions.
- Highlight gaps the candidate should strengthen (e.g., missing metrics, stakeholder impact, prioritization).
- Avoid yes/no phrasing or repetitive wording; every question should push a new skill or competency.

# Style
